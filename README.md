# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
<p> I have a knack for excellent design, human-fit and business-driving web experiences, and facts. I love challenging projects and have worked on a few showcasing or interconnecting my expertise in graphic design, product design, frontend engineering, and data analytics.
If I am not crafting designs and web experiences, I am analyzing data, buildings, and structures, listening to music, playing my talking drum, or enjoying myself on one book.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently upskilling by building projects and learning more with the Meta Frontend, X-box Graphic Design and Google Data Analytics courses on Coursera.
