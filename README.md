# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
<p> I have a knack for excellent design, human-fit and business-driving web experiences and data analysis. I love and have worked on awesome projects interconnecting my acquired professional know-how on graphic design, product design, frontend engineering and data analysis.
If I am not crafting designs and web experiences, I am analysing data, buildings and strucutures, listening to music, playing my talking drum or enjoying myself on one book.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently revising Python Programming using the PY4E textbook by Prof. Charles Severance.
