# Hi there! 👋
<p> I have a knack for excellent design, human-fit and business-driving web experiences. I love and have worked on awesome projects interconnecting my acquired professional know-how on graphic design, product design and frontend engineering.
If I am not crafting designs and web experiences, I am analysing buildings and strucutures, listening to music, playing my talking drum or enjoying myself improving.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning core JavaScript basics and its activities under the hood on FrontEnd Masters.
